##### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

-  Describe basic concepts in nutrition

-  Describe factors that affect your nutritional needs

-  Describe the importance of research and scientific

methods to understanding nutrition

### What are Nutrients?

The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances

required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must

be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not

synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three

basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,

and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic

functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental

surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and

reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body

to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,

lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain

non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common

in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or

beneficial (such as antioxidants).


-----

### Macronutrients

Nutrients that are needed in large amounts are called

macronutrients. There are three classes of macronutrients:

carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically

processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients

comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is

converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,

allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of

measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels

the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie

multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,

denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a

capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in

the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other

macronutrients, it does not yield calories.

##### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and

oxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,

fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables

also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates

are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical

structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and

complex carbohydrates.

Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples

of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have

in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that

circulates in your blood.

Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can

be unbranched or branched. During digestion, the body breaks


-----

down digestible complex carbohydrates to simple sugars, mostly

glucose. Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is

stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber

is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by

digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes

through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that

inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.

One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of

energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to

providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger

macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning

of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose

can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage

molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is

known as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates.

##### Lipids

Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen,

and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.

Lipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy

products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three

main types of lipids are triglycerides (triacylglycerols),

phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or

store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than

carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four

kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy

storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes,

surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide

insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other

functions in the body.


-----

##### Proteins

Proteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called

amino acids. Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon,

oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include

meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant
based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a

Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt

description of these macronutrients; they are also known

colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four

kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not

protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to

bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the

chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate

that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist

within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically

protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different

amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific

proteins.

##### Water

There is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities:

water. Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two

hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60

percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could

be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not

occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would

fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters

of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so

critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and

output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in

Chapter 4.

### Micronutrients

Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser

amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions.

Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins.

There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See

Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2

“Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their

major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins,

micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist

in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e.,

coenzymes). Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions

in the body and are involved in all aspects of body functions from

producing energy, to digesting nutrients, to building

macromolecules. Micronutrients play many essential roles in the

body.

##### Minerals

Minerals are solid inorganic substances that form crystals and are

classified depending on how much of them we need. Trace minerals,

such as molybdenum, selenium, zinc, iron, and iodine, are only

required in a few milligrams or less. Macrominerals, such as calcium,

magnesium, potassium, sodium, and phosphorus, are required in

hundreds of milligrams. Many minerals are critical for enzyme


-----

function, others are used to maintain fluid balance, build bone

tissue, synthesize hormones, transmit nerve impulses, contract and

relax muscles, and protect against harmful free radicals in the body

that can cause health problems such as cancer.

##### Vitamins

The thirteen vitamins are categorized as either water-soluble or

fat-soluble. The water-soluble vitamins are vitamin C and all the

B vitamins, which include thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic

acid, pyridoxine, biotin, folate and cobalamin. The fat-soluble

vitamins are A, D, E, and K. Vitamins are required to perform many

functions in the body such as making red blood cells, synthesizing

bone tissue, and playing a role in normal vision, nervous system

function, and immune system function.

Table 1.2 Vitamins and Their Major Functions

D
function

E Antioxidant, cell membrane protection

K Bone and teeth health maintenance, blood clotting

Vitamin deficiencies can cause severe health problems and even

death. For example, a deficiency in niacin causes a disease called

pellagra, which was common in the early twentieth century in some

parts of America. The common signs and symptoms of pellagra

are known as the “4D’s—diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death.”

Until scientists found out that better diets relieved the signs and

symptoms of pellagra, many people with the disease ended up

hospitalized in insane asylums awaiting death. Other vitamins were

also found to prevent certain disorders and diseases such as scurvy

(vitamin C), night blindness vitamin A, and rickets (vitamin D).

One measurement of food quality is the amount of nutrients it

contains relative to the amount of energy it provides. High-quality

foods are nutrient-dense, meaning they contain significant amounts

of one or more essential nutrients relative to the amount of calories

they provide. Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of “empty
calorie” foods such as carbonated sugary soft drinks, which provide

many calories and very little, if any, other nutrients. Food quality is

additionally associated with its taste, texture, appearance, microbial

content, and how much consumers like it.

##### Food: A Better Source of Nutrients

It is better to get all your micronutrients from the foods you eat

as opposed to from supplements. Supplements contain only what is


-----

listed on the label, but foods contain many more macronutrients,

micronutrients, and other chemicals, like antioxidants, that benefit

health. While vitamins, multivitamins, and supplements are a $20

billion industry in the United States, and more than 50 percent

of Americans purchase and use them daily, there is no consistent

evidence that they are better than food in promoting health and

preventing disease.

##### Everyday Connection

Make a list of some of your favorite foods and visit the

“What’s In the Foods You Eat?” search tool provided by the

USDA. What are some of the nutrients found in your

favorite foods?

# Units of Measure

**UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN**
**NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM**

In nutrition, there are two systems of commonly used

measurements: Metric and US Customary. We need both because

the US won’t adopt the metric system completely.

##### The Metric and US Customary System

These are commonly used prefixes for the Metric System:

Micro- (μ) 1/1,000,000th (one millionth)

Milli- (m) 1/1000th (one thousandth)

Centi- (c) 1/100th (one hundredth)

Deci- (d) 1/10th (one tenth)

Kilo- (k) 1000x (one thousand times)

##### Mass

Metric System US Customary System Conversions

Microgram (μg) Ounce (oz) 1 oz = 28.35 g

Milligram (mg) Pound (lb) 1 lb = 16 oz

Gram (g) 1 lb = 454 g

Kilogram (kg) 1 kg = 2.2 lbs


-----

##### Volume

Metric System US Customary System Conversions

Milliliter (mL) Teaspoon (tsp) 1 tsp = 5 mL

Deciliter (dL) Tablespoon (tbsp) 1 tbsp = 3 tsp = 15 mL

Liter (L) Fluid ounce (fl oz) 1 fl oz = 2 tbsp = 30 mL

Cup (c) 1 c = 8 fl oz = 237 mL

Pint (pt) 1 pt = 2 c = 16 fl oz

Quart (qt) 1 qt = 4 c = 32 fl oz = 0.95 L

Gallon (gal) = 4 qt 1 gal = 4 qt

##### Length

Metric System US Customary System Conversions

Millimeter (mm) Inch (in) 1 in = 25.4 mm

Centimeter (cm) Foot (ft) 1 ft= 30.5 cm

Meter (m) Yard (yd) 1 yd = 0.9 m
